/*What is Exception
An error occurs during the program execution is called Exception in PL/SQL.
PL/SQL facilitates programmers to catch such conditions using exception block 
in the program and an appropriate action is taken against the error condition.*/

/*Types:
There are three type of exceptions:
1. Internally defined exceptions are errors which arise from the Oracle Database environment. 
The runtime system raises the internally defined exceptions automatically. 
ORA-27102 (out of memory) is one example of Internally defined exceptions. Note that 
Internally defined exceptions do not have names, but an error code.
2. Predefined exceptions are errors which occur during the execution of the program. The predefined 
exceptions are internally defined exceptions that PL/SQL has given names e.g., NO_DATA_FOUND, TOO_MANY_ROWS.

Exception                      Raised when....
DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX         When you try to insert a duplicate value into a unique column.
INVALID_CURSOR             It occurs when we try accessing an invalid cursor.
INVALID_NUMBER              On usage of something other than number in place of number value.
LOGIN_DENIED              At the time when user login is denied.
TOO_MANY_ROWS              When a select query returns more than one row and the destination variable can take only single value.
VALUE_ERROR                  When an arithmetic, value conversion, truncation, or constraint error occurs.
CURSOR_ALREADY_OPEN           Raised when we try to open an already open cursor.

3. User-defined exceptions are custom exception defined by users like you. User-defined exceptions 
must be raised explicitly.

The following table illustrates the differences between exception categories.

Category - Definer -  Has Error Code - Has Name - Raised Implicitly - Raised Explicitly
Internally defined - Runtime system - Always - Only if you assign one -    Yes - Optionally
Predefined - Runtime system - Always - Always - Yes - Optionally
User-defined - User - Only if you assign one - Always -    No - Always*/

/* Declare a handler:
To declare a handler, you use the  DECLARE HANDLER statement as follows:

DECLARE action HANDLER FOR condition_value statement;
If a condition whose value matches the  condition_value , MySQL will execute the statement 
and continue or exit the current code block based on the action .

The action accepts one of the following values:
1. CONTINUE :  the execution of the enclosing code block ( BEGIN â€¦ END ) continues.
2. EXIT : the execution of the enclosing code block, where the handler is declared, terminates.

The  condition_value specifies a particular condition or a class of conditions that activate the handler. 
The  condition_value accepts one of the following values:
1. A MySQL error code.
2. A standard SQLSTATE value. Or it can be an SQLWARNING , NOTFOUND or SQLEXCEPTION condition, 
which is shorthand for the class of SQLSTATE values. The NOTFOUND condition is used for a cursor 
or  SELECT INTO variable_list statement.
3. A named condition associated with either a MySQL error code or SQLSTATE value.

The statement could be a simple statement or a compound statement enclosing by the BEGIN and END keywords.*/

/*MySQL error handling examples:
1. The following handler set the value of the  hasError variable to 1 and continue the execution 
if an SQLEXCEPTION occurs:

DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION SET hasError = 1;

2. The following handler rolls back the previous operations, issues an error message, and exit 
the current code block in case an error occurs. If you declare it inside the BEGIN END block of a 
stored procedure, it will terminate the stored procedure immediately.
DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
BEGIN
    ROLLBACK;
    SELECT 'An error has occurred, operation rollbacked and the stored procedure was terminated';
END;

3. The following handler sets the value of the  RowNotFound variable to 1 and continues execution 
if there is no more row to fetch in case of a cursor or SELECT INTO statement:

DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND 
SET RowNotFound = 1;

4. If a duplicate key error occurs, the following handler issues an error message and continues execution.
DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR 1062
SELECT 'Error, duplicate key occurred';*/
